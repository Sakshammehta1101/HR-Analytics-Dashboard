# HR Analytics Dashboard
## Project Objective
The HR Department wants to create an HR Analytics Dashboard to understand employee attrition trends, job satisfaction levels, and workforce demographics. This will help management identify the key reasons for employee turnover and implement effective retention strategies to improve employee engagement and reduce attrition in the coming years.
Dataset Used

## Dataset Name: HR Data.xlsx
- <a href="https://github.com/Sakshammehta1101/HR-Analytics-Dashboard/blob/main/HR%20Data.xlsx">HR Data.xlsx</a> 

Dataset Size: 1,470 employee records
Key Fields: Age, Gender, Department, Education Field, Job Role, Attrition Status, Job Satisfaction, etc.

## Questions (KPIs)
What is the overall attrition rate in the company?
Which department faces the highest attrition?
Which education fields contribute most to attrition?
What is the distribution of employees by age group?
How does attrition vary by gender across age groups?
What are the job satisfaction levels across different job roles?
Which age group has the highest number of employees?
What is the comparison of attrition count between males and females?

## Process
Verified and cleaned the dataset (HR Data.xlsx) for missing values and inconsistencies.
Standardized categorical variables like Department, Education Field, and Job Roles.
Created calculated fields (e.g., attrition rate, active employees).
Built multiple visualizations in Tableau:
Pie Charts (Department-wise Attrition, Gender-wise Attrition)
Bar Charts (Education-wise Attrition, Age Group Analysis)
Heatmap (Job Satisfaction by Role)
KPI Cards (Employee Count, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate)
Combined all visualizations into a single interactive dashboard.

## Dashboard

## Project Insights
Attrition Rate: 16.12% overall attrition.
Department Impact: Sales department has the highest attrition (56.12%).
Education Field Impact: Employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds have the highest attrition.
Age Group: Employees aged 25–34 years have the highest attrition (29.11%).
Gender: Attrition is higher among males (150) compared to females (87).
Job Satisfaction: Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists report lower job satisfaction compared to other roles.

## Final Conclusion
The company’s attrition is primarily concentrated in the Sales department, particularly among employees aged 25–34 years with Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds.
To reduce attrition and improve retention, HR should:
Focus on employee engagement programs for the Sales team.
Introduce career growth and mentorship opportunities for younger employees.
Address job satisfaction issues in technical and scientific roles (Lab Technicians, Research Scientists).
Develop targeted retention strategies for male employees in the 25–34 age group.
By acting on these insights, the company can improve employee satisfaction, reduce turnover costs, and build a stronger workforce.
